MVRT could always use more help from parent volunteers and it is not a matter of
whether they are engaged in the field of engineering or not. Parents can help us
with things from animations to making food for members on late nights, even just
supervising us would be extremely appreciated. It would also be nice if we can
get sponsor support from parents' companies or donations because some of our
sponsors actually matches it up. Below is a survey that we would like parents to
fill up so MVRT can better organize parents' efforts in supporting us.
