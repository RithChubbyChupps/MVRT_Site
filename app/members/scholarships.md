Colleges, universities, corporations, and associations make almost $14 millions
worth of scholarships available to students who participate in FIRST. These
scholarships are available to those involved with either the FRC or FTC program.

Some of these scholarships are only open to students who plan to pursue majors
in STEM fields, while others are applicable for any major. Both high school
juniors and seniors have scholarships available to them, so be sure to check
these out.
